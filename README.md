# PortfolioHomework
Created an online portfolio for future projects. As of yet, as a total beginner, I do not have any projects to post on my site, but I did include some placeholers (named project1, project2, and project3. The layout and all elements are responsive, and I included a sticky footer as a bonus. I have included one media query (so that my project pictures not collapse on a small screen).

My bio at the moment is filled with placeholder text, I'm curious to ask carreer services about what to include in seeing as I am brand new to the field. Also, I plan to take some good headshots of myself to include in the About Me section to replace the placeholders.
