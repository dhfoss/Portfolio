            Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. That's my family Kay, that's not me. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. When they come... they come at what you love. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful?

            What's wrong with being a lawyer? If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. It's not personal. It's business. Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.

            It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry.
